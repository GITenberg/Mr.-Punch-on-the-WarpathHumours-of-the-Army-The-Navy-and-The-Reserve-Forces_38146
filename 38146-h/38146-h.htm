<h2>"FORWARD!"</h2>

<p>Was there ever protean like <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span>! The little man is a wonder. In so
many guises do we encounter him&mdash;now as tourist, again as playgoer, as
huntsman, as artist, as bohemian, and equally as stay-at-home
philistine, on the bench and on the golf-links, ashore and afloat, where
not and how not?&mdash;that we need be in no wise surprised to find him on
the warpath. Is he not the official jester of a warlike people?</p>

<p>Of course it may be suggested that in the present book we do not have
what is entirely a record of his achievements on many a well-fought
field. There are not many echoes here of real red war, but the mimic
battle with its humours is well in evidence. The only recent experience
of the real thing leaves <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span> too sore of heart to say much about
it. But as we are all believers in the maxim "in time of peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> prepare
for war," and as most of our time is peaceful, we are always
"preparing"&mdash;hence, perhaps, the reason why we are never ready. But
there is a deal of humour in the process, and it is for fun we look to
<span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span>. Nor shall we look vainly here, for in the past Charles Keene
found many of his happiest subjects in the humours of military life and
volunteering, while to-day Mr. Raven-Hill, himself an enthusiastic
volunteer, ably carries on the tradition, and has many brilliant aiders
and abettors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span> is, by turns, general, drum major, full private, cavalry man
and "kiltie," he is also A. B. when the occasion serves, and would be
horse-marine if necessary! At all events he has given the command, and
it's "Forward!"</p>

<h2>THE BEAUTY OF BISLEY</h2>

<p>That it takes you away from town in the dog days for a clear fortnight.</p>

<p>That, being farther away from London than Wimbledon, you escape the more
easily the attention of those who love tea, flirtation, and strawberries
and cream.</p>

<p>That there is plenty to do at the ranges with the rifle, and to see in
the neighbourhood on a bicycle.</p>

<p>That the conversation of your comrades is congenial, if slightly
"shoppy."</p>

<p>That, after all, it is better to talk all day of scores, than of links
or tyres.</p>

<p>That if the life becomes too monotonous, a train can carry you back to
Waterloo in forty minutes.</p>

<p>That life under canvas is recommended by the doctors when it is subject
to certain favourable climatic conditions.</p>

<p>That, with the power of enjoying your outing to the end, or cutting it
short at the beginning, you can yet claim credit for your self-denial
and patriotism.</p>

<p><i>Officer.</i> I want to see the Commander-in-Chief at once.</p>

<p><i>Messenger.</i> Very sorry, sir, but that gentleman who has just entered
the room is likely to be there for the next three hours. He came here
two minutes before your arrival.</p>

<p><i>Officer.</i> But is a civilian allowed to take precedence of an officer in
full uniform?</p>

<p><i>Messenger.</i> Beg your pardon, sir, but he is not a civilian; but an
officer like yourself.</p>

<p><i>Officer.</i> And yet he is admitted in mufti! Why, here have I had to come
up from the country in full rig, being chaffed at the railway station,
grinned at by the cabman, and cheered by the crowd!</p>

<p><i>Messenger.</i> Yes, sir. Very sorry you should have been inconvenienced,
sir, especially as it was unnecessary, sir!</p>

<p><i>Officer.</i> Unnecessary! Why, doesn't the order come into force to-day
that all officers who appear in the War Office for any purpose
whatsoever must be attired in the proper uniform of their rank and
regiment?</p>

<p><i>Messenger.</i> No, sir. To-morrow, sir, the <i>second</i> of April, is the
proper date. To-day, sir, is the <i>first</i> of April.</p>

<h2>MILITARY SURGERY</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Field-Marshal Punch.</span>&mdash;In a telegram from the seat of war this week
I find the following obscure passage. "General Blank held the enemy's
main body whilst General Dash carried out his movements." Knowing your
skill in tactics, may I ask if you can explain this to me either
verbally or pictorially. Used in contradistinction to his main body, I
presume the enemy's "movements" must be his limbs, and if all four were
carried out by this barbarous general, it would be certainly a feat of
arms, and the movement might be said to be al-leg-ro. Nothing is said as
to whether the enemy survived this fearful operation depriving him of
his members, but it may be a case of a truncated despatch. Then, where
were the movements carried out to? If the presumption stated above be
correct, I infer it must have been to the region of limbo, but the army
in Flanders never practised such lopsided man&oelig;uvres.</p>

joining the new rifle clubs, throughout the country."&mdash;<i>Daily
Press.</i>]</p>

<center>EXTRACT FROM THE NEW RULES</center>

<p>1. In face of the enemy the rifle must be fired as quickly as possible,
and then passed on to the next man.</p>

<p>2. No squabbling in the ranks, as to whose turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> it is to shoot, shall
be allowed by the commanding officer, and his decision shall be final.</p>

<p>3. The other nine men, whilst awaiting their turn, must stand at
"attention," and scowl fiercely at the enemy.</p>

<p>4. Where the commanding officer, in his discretion, sees opportunity for
so doing, he shall employ several men simultaneously, to fire the
rifle&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> one to hold the rifle to his shoulder, a second to close
his left eye, and a third to pull the trigger. This plan would leave
only seven men out of ten unemployed.</p>

<p>5. The above-named seven would be at liberty to throw things at the
enemy whilst awaiting their turn for the rifle.</p>

<p>6. In actual warfare, the commanding officer may request the enemy to
wait a reasonable time whilst the solitary rifle is handed round, after
being fired off.</p>

<p>7. Whilst an attack is going on, the unemployed men of a company shall
not be allowed to leave the ranks to play, but should be encouraged to
take an intelligent interest in the shooting prowess of their solitary
comrade.</p>

<h2>MR. BROWN AT BREAKFAST</h2>

<center><span class="smcap">On the Army.</span></center>

<p>Astonishing lot of nonsense the <i>Daily Wire</i> prints about military
affairs ... no, I do <i>not</i> waste my time reading it. Any intelligent
citizen, Mary, is bound to take an interest in things of this sort. And
our army is rotten, madam&mdash;rotten to the core.... What? That reminds
you, shall Tomkins be told to pick the apples? As you please&mdash;I'm not
talking about apples. Just consider these man&oelig;uvres, and the plain
common-sense lessons they teach you. First of all, a force lands in
England without opposition. There's a pretty state of things!... No, I
didn't say they <i>had</i> interfered with us&mdash;but just think of the
disgrace! Not one general, madam, not one single general capable of
defending this unhappy country. And yet it is to support these expensive
frauds that I have to pay taxes!... Well, if he calls again, tell him
that I will attend to the matter. There's the rent and rates to be seen
to first, and goodness knows, with your housekeeping and Ethel's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> dress
bills&mdash;but I was talking about the army.</p>

<p>Incompetent profligates, that's what the officers are. What sort of life
do they lead? Getting up late, playing polo and hunting, eating
luxurious dinners, bullying respectable young men and ducking them in
horse-ponds&mdash;there's a life for you.... What do you know <i>about</i> it,
Miss Ethel?... Captain Ponsonby told you? You can tell <i>him</i> something
then. Tell him that Britons of common-sense&mdash;like myself&mdash;don't mean to
stand the present way of going on much longer. Drastic changes.... No,
I'm not trying to break the table, Mary ... drastic changes are
absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>First of all, there must be a clean sweep at the War Office. Men of
brains and common-sense are wanted there. Then we must organise a great
army, to guard the coast all round England. The man who will not serve
his time as a militiaman or volunteer is not worthy of the name of
English-man, and the fruit.... I told you once about those apples, I do
wish you wouldn't interrupt.... If they are not picked to-day they'll
have to wait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> for three weeks? Why? Tomkins can pick them next time he
comes. As I was saying, the militia system must be developed, and&mdash;eh?
Tomkins won't be here for three weeks? Got to go into camp for his
training? Well, I call it perfectly disgraceful! Here I pay a man high
wages to attend to my garden once a week, and then this miserable system
takes him away, at the most inconvenient time, to play at soldiers!...
If I have time to-night, Mary, I shall write a strongish letter to the
<i>Daily Wire</i> on the subject.</p>

<p>In the House of Commons, and elsewhere, the Secretary of State for War
is accustomed to have appeals made to him to assist in providing
facilities for the engagement and remunerative occupation of soldiers
and non-commissioned officers no longer on active service. We are glad
to notice, from the subjoined advertisement, which appeared in the
<i>Daily News</i>, that the public themselves are taking the matter in
hand:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>TWO GENERALS WANTED, as Cook and Housemaid for one lady. Light,
comfortable situation. Good wages.&mdash;Apply, &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>The advertiser, it will be observed, flies at higher rank than that
usually considered in this connection. But the situation is "light" and
"comfortable," with "good wages" pertaining, and she has some right to
look for applicants of superior station. We presume that on festive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
occasions the gallant officers would be expected to don their uniforms.
Few things would be more striking than to see a general, probably
wearing his war medals, sweeping the front door-step, whilst through the
kitchen window a glimpse was caught of a brother officer, in full tog,
larding a pheasant.</p>

<h2>THE FORTUNE OF WAR</h2>

<center>(<i>A fragment of a Military Romance, to be published a few years hence</i>)</center>

<blockquote><p>["The long-proposed introduction of motor-cars into the army for
transport purposes is on the point of accomplishment."&mdash;<i>The
Outlook.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p>... "<span class="smcap">Comrades!</span>" cried the proud general, addressing his troops (standing
around him in the circular square ordered by the latest drill book), "at
last we are about to reap the reward of our exertions. Thanks to our
trusty motor-cars, we have traversed the desert at an average speed of
twenty-five miles an hour. Our casualties have been few and
insignificant. A dozen or so of the engines blew up, but not more than
fifty men perished by these accidents. We have, indeed, to mourn the
loss of some of the 75th Dragoons, whose motor-car went wrong in its
steering, and rushed at express speed into the middle of a lake. And not
a few of our heroes have been arrested by the native police on the
charge of furious driving, with the result that they now languish in
dungeons, awaiting bail. But what are these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> trifles, compared with the
glory that will soon be ours? The enemy are now within thirty miles of
us&mdash;a distance which, with a little extra pressure, we can cover in an
hour. So, forward! Mount motor-cars! Tie down the safety-valves! Seize
starting levers! Now, when I give the word! Are you read&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment a grey-haired officer interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Alas, sir!" he cried, "we cannot advance! It is impossible!"</p>

<p>"Impossible?" echoed the general, in amazement. "Why?"</p>

<p>"For the very good reason that&mdash;<i>we've run out of oil!</i>"</p>

<p>A loud groan burst from the army on hearing the dreadful news; the voice
of the general himself shook as he replied:</p>

<p>"Then, for once, we must ride."</p>

<p>"You forget, sir," said the other, "that nowadays we have no horses.
Shall we&mdash;march?"</p>

<p>"No!" cried the intrepid leader. "March? Never! Death before dishonour!
Men, your general may have to die a rather unpleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> death; but never,
in this scientific age, never will he insult you by suggesting that you
should walk!" and rapturous cheers from the army greeted this noble
utterance. But just when hope was dying in every breast, and the only
possible course seemed to be to wait patiently until the enemy attacked
and destroyed them, a small motor-car with red-hot bearings whizzed
through the crowd and stopped before the general. Need we mention that
its driver was none other than Henry de Plantagenet? (He's my hero, of
course, and he went out scouting on his own account&mdash;as heroes do&mdash;in
the last chapter.)</p>

<p>"Sir," he cried triumphantly, "I have news, great news!"</p>

<p>"Well?" said the general.</p>

<p>"Yes, it <i>is</i> a well, a well of natural petroleum, in fact, which I have
discovered not half-a-mile away!"</p>

<p>The general clasped his hand, while the army roared themselves hoarse
with delight. And, an hour later, only a faint flicker of dust on the
horizon showed where the expedition was scurrying towards the doomed
enemy.</p>

<h2>THE MILITARY COOKERY-BOOK</h2>

<p><i>How to make a Recruit.</i>&mdash;Take a raw lad from the country (the younger
the better) and fill his head with military froth. Add a shilling and as
much beer as will be covered by the bounty-money. Let him simmer, and
serve him up thick before a magistrate the next morning. Let him be
sworn in, and he will then be nicely done.</p>

<p><i>How to make a Soldier.</i>&mdash;Take your recruit, and thrust him roughly into
a depôt. Mix him up well with recruits from other regiments until he has
lost any <i>esprit de corps</i> which may have been floating upon the surface
when he enlisted. Now let him lie idle for a few years until his
strength is exhausted, and then, at ten minutes' notice, pack him off to
India.</p>

<p><i>Another Method.</i>&mdash;Take your recruit, and place him at headquarters. Let
him mix freely with all the bad characters that have been carefully kept
in the regiment, until his nature has become assimilated to theirs. For
three years pay him rather less than a ploughboy's wages, and make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> him
work harder than a costermonger's donkey. Your soldier having now
reached perfection, you will turn him out of the service with economical
dressing.</p>

<p><i>How to make a Deserter.</i>&mdash;A very simple and popular dish. Take a
soldier, see that he is perfectly free from any mark by which he may be
identified, and fill his head with grievances. Now add a little
opportunity, and you have, or, rather, you have not, your deserter.</p>

<p><i>Another and Simpler Method.</i>&mdash;Take a recruit, without inquiring into
his antecedents. Give him his kit and bounty-money and close your eyes.
The same recruit may be used for this dish (which will be found to be a
fine military hash) any number of times.</p>

<p><i>How to make an Army.</i>&mdash;Take a few scores of infantry regiments and
carefully proceed to under-man them. Add some troopers without horses
and some batteries without guns. Throw in a number of unattached
generals, and serve up the whole with a plentiful supply of control
mixture.</p>

<p><i>Another and easier Method.</i>&mdash;Get a little ink, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> pen, and a sheet of
paper. Now dip your pen in the ink, and with it trace figures upon your
sheet of paper. The accompaniment to this dish is usually hot water.</p>

<p><i>How to make a Panic.</i>&mdash;Take one or two influential newspapers in the
dead season of the year, and fill them with smartly written letters. Add
a few pointed leading articles, and pull your army into pieces. Let the

<h2>PREPARING FOR WAR</h2>

<p>A Memorandum containing a list of rules to be observed during the autumn
man&oelig;uvres has just been issued. By some strange mistake, the
following regulations (which evidently must have appeared in the
original document) have been omitted. They are now published for the
first time:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Recruits of tender years will not be allowed to draw their bayonets.
This rule does not apply to fine growing lads of twelve years old.</p>

<p>2. Buglers will not sound their bugles except by special command of
Generals of Divisions. The above-mentioned officers are reminded (for
their instruction and guidance) that copper is expensive and should be
used as little as possible.</p>

<p>3. Boots will not be worn by the infantry on any march exceeding three
miles. Commanding officers are cautioned that shoe-leather has recently
greatly increased in value.</p>

<p>4. In the event of two members of the umpire staff being unable to come
to an agreement about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> the respective colours of black and white, they
will "draw lots;" <i>id est</i>, one of them will throw into the air a coin
of the realm, and before the coin is able to reach the ground, the other
will give the word either "heads" or "tails." The choice of cries will
be optional. Gold coins will be used by general officers, silver by
field officers, and halfpence by all other ranks.</p>

<p>5. Dismounted cavalry will not be allowed to pursue retiring infantry on
horseback, unless so ordered by the Commanding Officers of the 83rd
(County of Dublin), 85th (the King's County Down), the Connaught
Rangers, and the Royal Irish Fusiliers.</p>

<p>6. Should a regiment of infantry halt within two hundred yards of six
hostile batteries of artillery to watch the practice, or for any other
purpose of instruction, one-tenth of the battalion will be marched to
the rear, and will be considered <i>hors de combat</i> during the remainder
of the campaign.</p>

<p>7. A village containing one pioneer, one drummer (or bugler) and a
quarter-master-sergeant, will be considered fully garrisoned. It will be
seen that rules of war are to be followed in every particular,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> down to
the very smallest details, by all concerned in the campaign.</p>

<p>8. As in the previous series of autumn man&oelig;uvres, <i>at least</i>, "five
minutes' notice" will be given when the army is required to march five
miles, or to perform any other military duty requiring zeal, steadiness,
and an intimate acquaintance with "Field Exercises, Edition of 1874,
Part I."</p>

<h2>MILITARY DIALOGUES</h2>

<center>I<br />

<span class="smcap">Army Reform</span></center>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>.&mdash;<i>The drawing-room of the Colonel's quarters, decorated with
trophies from many lands and water-colour sketches. Mrs. Bulkwise, the
Colonel's wife, a tall, broad and assertive lady, is giving tea to Mrs.
Lyttleton-Cartwright, with the stamp of fashion upon her, and Mrs.
Karmadine, who has a soul for art&mdash;both ladies of the regiment. Colonel
Bulkwise, a small and despondent man whose hair is "part-worn" gazes
morosely into the fire</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mrs. Bulkwise</i> (<i>waving a tea cup</i>). As surely as woman is asserting
her right to a place in medicine, in law, and in the council, so surely
will she take her proper place in the control of the army.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lyttleton-Cartwright.</i> What a lovely costume one could compose out
of the uniform. I've often tried Jack's tunic on.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> (<i>severely</i>). The mere brutal work of fighting, the butchery
of the trade, would still have to be left to the men; but such matters
as require higher intelligence, keener wit, tact, perseverance, should
be, and some day <i>shall</i> be, in our hands.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Karmadine.</i> And the beauty and grace of life, Mrs. Bulkwise.
Surely we women, if allowed, could in peace bring culture to the
barrack-room, and garland the sword with bay wreaths?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> Take the War Office. I am told that the ranks of the regiments
are depleted of combatant officers in order that they may sit in offices
in Pall Mall, and do clerical work indifferently. Now, I hold that our
sex could do this work better, more cheaply, and with greater dispatch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.-C.</i> "Pall-Mall" would be such an excellent address.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> The young men, both officers and civilians, who are employed
waste, so I understand, the time of the public by going out to lunch at
clubs and frequently pause in their work to smoke cigars and discuss the
odds. Now a glass of milk, or some claret and lemonade, a slice of
seed-cake, or some tartlets, brought by a maid from the nearest A. B. C.
shop would satisfy all our mid-day wants.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.-C.</i> And I never knew a woman who couldn't work and talk bonnets
at the same time.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> Just a few palms&mdash;don't you think, Mrs. Bulkwise?&mdash;in those
dreary, <i>dreary</i> rooms, and some oriental rugs on the floors, and a
little bunch of flowers on each desk would make life so much easier to
live.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Colonel Bulkwise murmurs something unintelligible</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> What do you say, George?</p>

<p><i>Colonel B. (with sudden fierceness).</i> I said, that there are too many
old women, as it is, in the War Office.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> George!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>The colonel relapses again into morose silence.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> The Intelligence Department should, of course, be in our
hands.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.-C.</i> I should just love to run about all the time, finding out
other people's secrets.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> And the Clothing Department calls for a woman's knowledge. The
hideous snuff-coloured garments must be retained for warfare, but with
the new costume for walking out and ceremonial I think something might
be done.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.-C.</i> The woman who makes my frocks is as clever as she can be,
and always has her head full of ideas for those sort of things.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> Michel Angelo did not disdain to design the uniform of the
Swiss Guard. Perhaps Gilbert, or Ford, or Brock might follow in the
giant's footsteps.</p>

<p><i>Col. B.</i> You ladies always design such sensible clothes for yourselves,
do you not?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>He is frozen into silence again.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> And the education of young officers. From a cursory glance
through my husband's books on law, topography and administration, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
should say that there are no military subjects that the average woman
could not master in a fortnight. Strategy, of course, comes to us by
intuition. The companionship and influence of really good women on
youths and young men cannot be over-rated, and the professors both at
the Staff College and at the Military Academy should be of our sex.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.-C.</i> I always love the boys; but I think some of the staff
college men are awfully stuck up.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> Now as to the regiment. The mess, of course, should be in our
province.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L.-C.</i> How ripping. The guest-nights would be lovely dinner
parties, the ante-room we'd use for tea, and the band should always play
from 5 to 6. We'd have afternoon dances every Thursday, and turn the men
out once a week and have a dinner all to ourselves to talk scandal.</p>

<h2>REGULATIONS FOR YEOMANRY OUTPOSTS</h2>

<center>(<i>Aldershot Edition</i>)</center>

<p>1. Never recognise your enemy when you meet him on the road, in case you
might be compelled to take him prisoner and so cause unpleasantness and
unseemly disturbance.</p>

<p>2. Advanced guards should walk quietly and without ostentation into the
enemy's main body, and be careful never to look behind bushes, trees, or
buildings for an unobtrusive cyclist patrol. To do so might cause the
enemy annoyance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>3. An advance guard, if surrounded, will surrender without noise or
alarm. To make any would disturb the main body, who like to march in a
compact and regular formation.</p>

<p>4. Never allow your common-sense to overcome your natural modesty so far
as to induce you to report to a superior officer the presence of the
enemy in force. You will only acquire a reputation for officiousness by
doing so.</p>

<p>5. Always attack an enemy in front. It is unsportsmanlike and
unprofessional to attack the flanks.</p>

<p>6. When retiring before an attack maintain as close a formation as the
ground will admit of, and retire directly upon the main infantry
support. You will thus expose yourselves to the fire of both your own
friends and the enemy, and as blank cartridge hurts nobody it will add
to the excitement of the operation.</p>

<p>7. It is more important to roll your cloaks and burnish your bits than
to worry about unimportant details of minor tactics.</p>

<p>8. Since a solitary horseman never attracts the enemy's attention, be
careful to take up a position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> in compact formation; to do so by files
might escape observation.</p>

<p>9. When being charged by the enemy, go fours about and gallop for all
you are worth; it is just as agreeable to be prodded in the back as in
the chest, and gives the enemy more satisfaction. To extend, or work to
the flanks, might deprive your enemy of useful experience.</p>

<p>10. Never cast your eyes to the direction from which the enemy is not
expected, as that is the usual direction of his real attack, and it is
not polite to spoil the arrangement of your friend the enemy.</p>

<p>11. Lastly, remember that the best motto for Yeomanry Troopers is "Point
de Zèle."</p>

<h2>CHAT À LA MODE</h2>

<p><i>Brown, Jones, and Robinson, discovered discussing the stats of the Navy
in a first-class compartment.</i></p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> My dear fellows, I can assure you we are in a terrible
condition of unpreparedness. If France was to declare war to-morrow we
should be nowhere&mdash;absolutely nowhere!</p>

<p><i>Jones.</i> You mean, of course, with Russia.</p>

<p><i>Robinson.</i> Or was it Italy?</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> It doesn't matter which. I fancy that France alone could tackle
us. Why, a man was telling me the other day that if Gibraltar was
seized&mdash;as it might be&mdash;we should not get a ship-load of wood for
months&mdash;yes, for months!</p>

<p><i>Jones.</i> But what has Gibraltar to do with it?</p>

<p><i>Robinson.</i> Why, of course, it guards our approaches to the Suez Canal.</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> Oh, that's only a matter of detail. But what we want is a
hundred millions to be spent at once. Cobden said so, and I agree with
Cobden.</p>

<p><i>Jones.</i> But upon what?</p>

<p><i>Robinson.</i> Oh, in supporting the Sultan, and subsidising the Ameer.</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> I don't think that sort of thing is of much importance. But if
we had a hundred millions (as Mr. Cobden suggested), we might increase
our coaling stations, and build new ships, and double the navy, and do
all sorts of things.</p>

<p><i>Jones.</i> But I thought we were fairly well off for coaling stations, had
lots of ships on the stocks, and, with the assistance of our merchant
marine, an ample supply of good sailors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Robinson.</i> That's what all you fellows say! But wait till we have a
war, then you will see the fallacy of all your arguments. No, we should
buy the entire fleet of the world. There should be no other competitor.
Britannia should <i>really</i> rule the waves.</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> Yes, yes. Of course; but after all, that is not the important
matter. What we want is a hundred millions available to be spent on
anything and everything. And it's no use having further discussion
because that was Cobden's view of it, and so it is mine.</p>

<p><i>Jones.</i> Where is it to come from&mdash;out of the rates?</p>

<p><i>Brown and Robinson</i> (<i>together</i>). Certainly not.</p>

<p><i>Jones.</i> Or the taxes?</p>

<p><i>Brown and Robinson</i> (<i>as before</i>). Don't be absurd.</p>

<p><i>Jones.</i> Well, it must come from somewhere! Can you tell me where?</p>

<p><i>Robinson.</i> Why should we?</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> Yes, why should we? Even Cobden didn't go so far as that,
and&mdash;&mdash;But, here we are at the station.</p>

<span class="smcap">Army Reform</span></center>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Scene.</span>&mdash;<i>The canteen of the Rutlandshire Regiment, at Downboro', an
airy, plastered hall with high windows. A bar at one end is backed
by a rampart of beer barrels. A double line of barrack tables and
benches runs down the room. The hour is 5 p.m. At one of the tables
sits Mr. W. Wilson, late Private in the regiment, in all his glory
of a new check suit with an aggressive pattern, a crimson tie, a
horseshoe pin, an aluminium watch-chain, a grey "bowler" and a
buttonhole of violets. Privates W. and G. Smith, P. Brady, E. Dudd
and other men of H. company are at the table, or standing near it.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mr. Wilson (passing round a great tin measure containing beer, after
taking a preliminary pull himself).</i> Of course I do 'ear more, being in
the smoke, than you 'ear down in this provincial 'ole; and there's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
generals and statesmen and such-like comes and stays at our place, and
when they gets tied up in a knot over any military question, as often as
not they says, "Let's ask Wilson, the under-gardener. 'E's a
hex-military man; 'e's a 'ighly intellergent feller"; and I generally
gets them out of their difficulty.</p>

<p><i>Pte. W. Smith.</i> D'ye know anything about this army reform?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Wilson (with lofty scorn).</i> Do I know anything about it?</p>

<p><i>Pte. G. Smith.</i> D'ye think they're going to make a good job of it?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Wilson.</i> Naaw. And why? Becos they're goin' the wrong wai to work.
They're arskin the opinion of perfeshernal hexperts and other sich
ignoramuses, and ain't goin' to the fountain 'ead. Oo's the backbone of
the English service?</p>

<p><i>Pte. P. Brady.</i> The Oirish private.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Wilson.</i> Right you are, my 'Ibernian&mdash;always subsitooting British
for Hirish&mdash;and the British compiny is the finest horganisation in the
world. Give the private a free 'and and a rise of pay, and make the
compiny the model of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> army, and then yer can put all the hexperts
and all the Ryle Commissions and their reports to bed.</p>

<p><i>Pte. Dudd.</i> As how?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Wilson.</i> As 'ow, yer old thick head? It's as plain as a pike-staff.
Taike this question of responsibility. When some one comes a bloomer,
and the paipers all rise 'ell, the civilian toff, 'oos a sort of a
commander-in-chief in a Sunday coat and a chimney-pot 'at, 'e says, "It
ain't me. Arsk the real commander-in-chief," and the feeld-marshal 'e
says, "Arsk the hadjutant-general," and the hadjutant-general, 'e says,
"Arsk the hordnance bloke." Now in the compiny there ain't none of that.
If the colonel goin' round at kit inspection finds the beds badly made
up, or jags and sight-protectors deficient, or 'oles in the men's socks,
'e goes fierce for the captin' and threatens to stop 'is leave; and the
captin' don't say, "Oh, it's the hadjutant, or the quarter-master, or
the chaplain what's to blame," no, 'e gives the subalterns and the
coloured-sergeant beans, and they slip it in to the sergeants and
corprils in charge of squads, and the beds is set up straight, and the
men put down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> for jags and sight-protectors, and the 'oles in the socks

<p><i>Pte. W. Smith.</i> That's so, old pal. What else would you recermend?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Wilson</i> (<i>reaching out for the measure).</i> Thank yer. This 'ere
army-reforming's a dry job. Now as to the metherd of attack. When the
regiment goes out field-firing the henemy's a line of hearthenware pots,
touched up on the sly by the markers with a dash of white; the captains
count the telergraph posts up the range and give the exact distance; and
the men goes 'opping along in line like crows on a ploughed field, the
sergeantes a-naggin' 'em about the 'Ithe position and the coprils
calling them back to pick up empty cartridge cases. Is that the wai,
that you, George Smith, and you, Bill, and you, Pat, used ter creep up
to the rabbit warrens when we used ter go out in the herly morning to
assist the farmers to keep down the ground gime&mdash;poaching the colonel
called it? No, we hexecuted wide turning movements and never showed no
more than the tip of a nose. Let drill of attack alone, I say, and
develop the sporting hinstinct of the private.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Omnes.</i> 'Ear, 'ear.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Wilson.</i> And this matter of mobility. Why, if you or me or any of
us was on furlough at 'Ampstead or Margit, we was never off a 'orse's or
a moke's back as long as the dibs lasted. Give us the brass, and we'll
find the mobility.</p>

<p><i>Pte. W. Smith.</i> Why don't yer write to the Prime Minister, and give him
your ideas?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Wilson.</i> I shall. A few hintelligent ex-privates in the Cabinet, a
rise of pay for privates and two days' rabitting, and a trip to Margit
every week would sive the British Army.</p>

<p><i>Marksman (cordially, but abruptly).</i> Capitally! Good-bye!</p>

<p><i>Loung.</i> But I say, what a hurry you are in! Can't you stop a minute for

<p><i>Marks.</i> Another time, but just now moments are precious.</p>

<p><i>Marks.</i> Of course it doesn't&mdash;whoever said it did? But there, old chap,
I <i>must</i> be off!</p>

<p><i>Loung.</i> You are in a hurry! Ah, we used to have pleasant days in the
old place?</p>

<p><i>Marks.</i> Did we? I daresay we did.</p>

<p><i>Loung.</i> Why, of course! Grand old days! Don't you remember what fun it
used to be decorating your tent; and then, when the ladies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> came
down&mdash;which they did nearly all the day long&mdash;what larks it was getting
them tea and claret-cup?</p>

<p><i>Marks.</i> Very likely. But we don't have many ladies now, and a good job,
too&mdash;they <i>are</i> a bore.</p>

<p><i>Loung.</i> Well, you <i>are</i> a chap! Why, how can there be any fun without
your sisters, and your cousins, and your maiden aunts?</p>

<p><i>Marks.</i> We don't want fun. But there, good-bye!</p>

<p><i>Loung.</i> But I say, I have come all this way to look you up.</p>

<p><i>Marks. (unbending).</i> Very kind of you, my dear fellow, you have chosen
rather an unfortunate time.</p>

<p><i>Loung.</i> Why, at Wimbledon you had nothing to do!</p>

<p><i>Marks.</i> Very likely. But then Bisley isn't Wimbledon.</p>

<p><i>Loung. (dryly).</i> So it seems. Everyone said that when they moved the
camp further away from home, they would ruin the meeting.</p>

<p><i>Marks.</i> Then everyone was wrong. Why, we are going on swimmingly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Loung.</i> It must be beastly dull.</p>

<p><i>Marks.</i> Not at all. Lovely country, good range, and, after it rains,
two minutes later it is dry as bone.</p>

<p><i>Loung.</i> Yes, but it stands to reason that it <i>can't</i> be as popular as
Wimbledon.</p>

<p><i>Marks.</i> My dear fellow, figures are the best test of that. In all the
history of the Association we never had more entries than this year.</p>

<p><i>Loung.</i> That may be, but you don't have half the fun you had nearer
town.</p>

<p><i>Marks. (laughing).</i> Don't want to! Business, my dear fellow, not
pleasure! And now, old man, I really <i>must</i> be off. Ta! ta! See you
later.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<h2>DO'S AND DONT'S FOR VOLUNTEERS</h2>

<center>1. <span class="smcap">Don't</span> go to camp. But if you do,</center>

<p>2. Don't get up when revally sounds. You'll find adjutant's parade in
the early morning, the very early morning, such a beastly bore, and so
bad for the liver that it is far wiser to stay in the
"palliasse"&mdash;(besides, hasn't your doctor often told you that it is
madness to suppose you can play such tricks at your time of life?)&mdash;they
can only give you a few years' imprisonment for repeated mutinous
conduct, and you could doubtless petition the Home Secretary for an
aggravation of your sentence.</p>

<p>3. Don't submit to harsh or cursory remarks from the adjutant. Do answer
him back. You know quite well that in private life you would not put up
with his hasty, ill-considered and offensive language, nor permit him to
hector you because your collar was not clean, and if you <i>have</i> come on
parade without cleaning your belt or rifle, what right has he to say
that it makes him furious? Do point out to him how absurd it is to
expect such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> minute attention to discipline on the part of so
intelligent a volunteer as yourself.</p>

<p>4. Don't overtax your strength or weaken your heart by "doubling" up
impossible hills, merely because the colonel (on a horse) thinks it
looks pretty. Of course you would be perfectly ready to do anything that
was necessary, but how can the empire's safety depend upon your losing
your wind, when the enemy are some of your oldest friends, with a
handkerchief tied round their sleeves?</p>

<p>5. Do insist upon having hot water to shave with, and an extra blanket
when the nights get chilly. Very probably the captain of your company
would turn out of his bed and take your palliasse if you asked him
nicely.</p>

<p>6. Don't do any menial or degrading work, such as cleaning cooking
utensils or greasing your own boots. The Government ought to know that
gentlemen can't be expected to do that kind of work, and should provide
an efficient staff of servants.</p>

better than your officers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<h2>BUTS AT BISLEY</h2>

<center><i>(Compiled by an evil-minded enthusiast)</i></center>

<p>The shooting could not be more satisfactory <i>but</i> for the customary
"accident."</p>

<p>Everyone would make a "bull" <i>but</i> for the haze and the shiftiness of
the wind.</p>

<p>The catering is in every way excellent, <i>but</i> heavy meals scarcely
assist in getting on the target.</p>

<p>It is delightful to entertain visitors&mdash;especially ladies&mdash;at the camp,
<i>but</i> champagne-cup and provisions generally run into money.</p>

<p>It is healthy to sleep under canvas, <i>but</i> when the thermometer marks
ninety in the shade or the rain pours down in torrents a bed in an inn
is preferable.</p>

<p>Bisley is a beautiful place, <i>but</i> Woking cemetery is a dismal
neighbour.</p>

<p>Distinctly it is nobly patriotic to spend a fortnight with the N. R. A.,
in the cause of the fatherland, <i>but</i> is it quite worth the trouble?</p>

<h2>MILITARY DIALOGUES</h2>

<center>III<br /><br />

HOW IT SHOULD NOT BE DONE</center>

<blockquote><p><i>Interior of a dreary room in the War Office. A tired-looking young
officer, in mufti, sits at a table with great piles of papers, each
bundle tied with red tape and ticketed with labels of different
colours, on one side of it ready to his hand. Another pile of
papers, which he has already dealt with, is on the other side of the
table. He is an official and has many letters, the first two being
D. A. after his name. The gas has just been lighted. A clerk brings
in another fat bundle of papers.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>The Officer (patting the smaller pile on the table).</i> These can go on,
Smithers. That question of sardine-openers must go back to the
commissariat, and the General commanding the Central District must be
authorised to deal on his own responsibility with the matter of the
fierce bull in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> field where the recruits bathe. What have you got
there?</p>

<p><i>The Clerk.</i> It is the correspondence, sir, relative to that false tooth
requisitioned for by the officer commanding the Rutlandshire Regiment
for the first cornet of the band. The Medical Department sent it back to
us this morning, and there is another letter in from the Colonel,
protesting against his regiment being forced to go route marching to an
imperfect musical accompaniment.</p>

<p><i>The Officer (groaning).</i> I thought we had got rid of that matter at
last by sending it to the doctors.</p>

<p><i>The Clerk.</i> No, sir. The Surgeon-General has decided that "one tooth,
false, with gold attachment," cannot be considered a medical comfort.</p>

<p><i>The Officer (taking a précis from the top of the papers).</i> I suppose we
must go into the matter again. It began with the letter from the Colonel
to the General?</p>

<p><i>The Clerk.</i> Yes, sir, here it is. The O. C. the Rutland Regiment has
the honour to report that the first cornet player in the band has lost
a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> tooth, and as the band has become inefficient in the playing of
marching music in consequence, he requests that a false tooth may be
supplied at Government expense.</p>

<p><i>The Officer.</i> And the General, of course, replied in the usual formula
that he had no fund available for such purpose.</p>

<p><i>The Clerk.</i> Yes, sir; but suggested that the regimental band fund might
be drawn on.</p>

<p><i>The Officer.</i> Where is the Colonel's letter in reply. (It is handed to
him.) Ah, yes. Band fund is established, he writes, for purchase of
musical instruments and music, and not for repair of incomplete
bandsmen, and refuses to authorise expense, except under order from the
Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p><i>The Clerk.</i> The General sends this on to us with a remark as to the
Colonel's temper.</p>

<p><i>The Officer.</i> And we pass it to the Quarter-Master-General's people,
suggesting that under certain circumstances a false tooth might be
considered a "necessary," and a free issue made.</p>

<p><i>The Clerk.</i> A very long memo, on the subject, in reply, from the
Q.-M.-G., sir. He points out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> that though, under exceptional
circumstances, a pair of spectacles might be held to be a
sight-protector, a false tooth could not be held to be either a fork, a
spoon, a shaving-brush, a razor, or even an oil bottle.</p>

<p><i>The Officer.</i> We wrote back suggesting that it might pass as a
"jag"&mdash;our little joke.</p>

<p><i>The Clerk.</i> <i>Your</i> little joke, sir. The Q.-M.-G.'s people didn't see
it.</p>

<p><i>The Officer.</i> No? Then the correspondence goes on to the Ordnance
Department, with a suggestion that a false tooth might be considered an
arm or an accoutrement.</p>

<p><i>The Clerk.</i> The Director-General replies, sir, that in the early days
of the British Army, when the Army Clothing Department's sole issue was
a supply of woad, a tooth, or indeed a nail, might have reasonably been
indented for as a weapon, but that, owing to the introduction and
perfection of fire-arms, such weapons are now obsolete and cannot be
issued.</p>

<p><i>The Officer.</i> And now the Medical Service refuse to help us.</p>

<p><i>The Clerk.</i> Yes, sir. They cannot bring the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> fixing of it under the
head of surgical operations, and the Surgeon-General points out very
justly, if I may be permitted to say so, sir, that a seal-pattern false
tooth could hardly be considered a "medical comfort."</p>

<p><i>The Officer.</i> What are we to do? The Colonel of the regiment is
evidently furious.</p>

<p><i>The Clerk.</i> We might send the correspondence to the Inspector of Iron
Structures. He may be able to do or suggest something.</p>

<p><i>The Officer.</i> Very well; and will you send off this telegram to my wife
saying I have a long evening's work before me, and that I shall not be
able to get back to dinner to-night? (<i>Exit the Clerk.</i>) Whenever will
they trust a General Commanding a District to spend for the public good
on his own responsibility a sum as large as a schoolboy's allowance, and
so take some of the unnecessary work off our shoulders?</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
